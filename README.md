# self-clearing-in-memory-cache

Pretty simple self clearing cache implementation.

Created for prototyping small API's where estimated user usage is small, and where using a proper or paid caching service isn't necessary,
but wanting to prevent any memory issues if there's a sudden influx of user input.
